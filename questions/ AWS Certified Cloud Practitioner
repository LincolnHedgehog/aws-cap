QUESTION 9
A telecommunications company has his hired you as a consultant to develop a business case for moving its IT applications and infrastructure to AWS. The company’s leadership understands the agility value of the cloud, but the finance group is not interested in shifting capital expense to operating expense due to the company’s tax structure. What will you include in the business case to attempt to satisfy everyone at the company?

[ ] Show the company the TCO value of moving to an operating expense model
[ ] Suggest that the company wait to migrate to AWS until the current infrastructure is fully depreciated
[ ] Suggest that the company make reserved instance purchases and capitalize them
[ ] Show the value of an elastic infrastructure for avoiding wasted capacity

EXPLANATION:
Many companies capitalize reserved instance purchases, especially those with 3-year terms. Waiting for current infrastructure to fully depreciate will cause the company to miss the other cloud benefits that are available. Moving the company to an operating expense model will prove too large a task, and will most likely result in a rejected business case. Elastic infrastructure is definitely a benefit, but doesn't address the capitalization issue.

Answer: c

[ ] There are more Availability Zones then Regions
[ ] There are more Regions than Availability zones
[ ] The number of Availability Zones is the same as the number of Regions
[ ] There are more Availability Zones than Edge locations

EXPLANATION:
Regions contain two or more Availability Zones, which are themselves made up of one or more Datacentres. This means there will always be more AZs than Regions. Edge locations are separate from AZs and Regions, and there are more Edge Locations than Regions and Availability Zones.

Answer: a

QUESTION 21
Which of the following is not part of the AWS Global infrastructure?

[ ] Regions
[ ] Security Groups

QUESTION 26
A mobile shopping list app needs to be able to add, delete, and update items on specific lists anytime a user desires. The backend for the app will run on Amazon EC2 instances with Auto Scaling to manage fluctuations in user demand. Many times, a user will perform maintenance on many list items in a single session. What design characteristic must be incorporated into the app for these requirements to be met?

[ ] Implement session affinity
[ ] Use bootstrapping on the EC2 instances
[ ] Leverage load balancing to distribute transactions to multiple nodes
[ ] Make sure the app doesn’t need knowledge of previous transactions

EXPLANATION:
In order for horizontal scaling to be effective, you'll want to make sure the app doesn't store previous transaction or session information on specific EC2 instances. That way, any EC2 instance provisioned by Auto Scaling can process the request. Leveraging load balancing is also a good practice, but doesn't address the need for a stateless app. Session affinity goes the other direction, directing a load balancer to route transactions to a specific instance each time. Bootstrapping runs scripts each time an EC2 instance is provisioned.

Answer: d

QUESTION 31
Under the Shared Responsibility Model, for which of the following does AWS not assume responsibility?

[ ] Customer data
[ ] Networking
[ ] Physical security of AWS facilities

Answer: a

QUESTION 36
Adding resources to your application as user demand grows is an example of which cloud concept?

[ ] High Availability
[ ] Scalability
[ ] Elasticity
[ ] Automation

EXPLANATION:
Scalability is the concept that as cloud has essentially limitless capacity, it allows you to expand out as needed - as detailed in the question. Automation relates to simplyfying common repeated tasks and removing the human element. Although elasticity (the ability to go up and down in resources as needed) is related, this question specifically ask for in in response to user demand, which is closer to Scalability. High Availability relates to the ability of your application to withstand failures in Cloud Infrastructure.

Answer: b

QUESTION 40
Which of the following best describes Availability Zones?

[ ] Restricted areas designed specifically for the creation of Virtual Private Clouds.
[ ] Two zones containing compute resources that are designed to automatically maintain synchronized copies of each other's data.
[ ] A Content Distribution Network used to deliver content to users
[ ] Distinct locations from within an AWS region that are engineered to be isolated from failures.

EXPLANATION:
Availability Zones are distinct locations from within an AWS region that are engineered to be isolated from failures. Each Region is made up of one or more AZs. Availability Zones host almost every AWS service, including EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and much more. Some services will maintain copies of your data between Availability Zones, but this is dependent on the individual service (for example, S3 can store data in multiple AZ's, where an EC2 instance is tied to a single AZ). AWS's Content Distribution Network (CDN) is known as CloudFront.

Answer: d

QUESTION 49
Which of the following are types of cloud computing deployments?

[ ] Private cloud
[ ] Mixed cloud
[ ] Public cloud
[ ] Hybrid cloud

EXPLANATION:
The three types of cloud deployments are: Public - where everyone and anyone can access that cloud's resources Private - also called on-premises where the underlying cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by a private entity for the sole use of that entity Hybrid - which is a mix of both. Mixed cloud is not a term used to describe a cloud computing deployment

Answer: a, c, d

QUESTION 52
You have a mission-critical application which must be globally available at all times. Which deployment strategy should you follow?

[ ] Multi-Availability Zone
[ ] Multi-Region
[ ] Multi-VPC in two AWS Regions
[ ] Deploy to all Availability Zones in your home region.

EXPLANATION:
A Multi-Region deployment will best ensure global availability. While it can be the most expensive, and complex to configure, Multi-Regional architectures will ensure that even if all Availability Zones in a single region fail due to a catastrophic event, your data will remain accessible.

Answer: b

QUESTION 55
Which of the following are advantages of cloud computing?

[ ] Variable expense
[ ] No specialist knowledge required
[ ] Elasticity - you need not worry about capacity.
[ ] Agility - Decreasing the time to start new services
[ ] Requires large amounts of capital

EXPLANATION:
Elasticity, Agility, and the ability to control the variances in your month-to-month expenditure are all advantages of the flexibility of Cloud Computing. You do still need specialist knowledge to deploy solutions in the Cloud, such as AWS Certifications. Large amounts of capital are also not needed due to the consumption model of most cloud services, although you can sometimes use capital expenditure to purchase resources for extended periods of time, such as Reserved Instances in EC2.

Answer: a, c, d

QUESTION 58
Which of the following is correct?

[ ] # of Edge Locations > # of Availability Zones > # of Regions
[ ] # of Availability Zones > # of Regions > # of Edge Locations
[ ] # of Availability Zones > # of Edge Locations > # of Regions
[ ] # of Regions > # of Availability Zones > # of Edge Locations

EXPLANATION:
The number of Edge Locations is greater than the number of Availability Zones, which is greater than the number of Regions. Regions contain Availability Zones, therefore there will always be more AZs than Regions.

Answer: a

QUESTION 62
How many Availability Zones does each Region have?

[ ] Regions don't have Availability Zones, Availability Zones have Regions
[ ] At least 2
[ ] At least 3
[ ] Only 1

EXPLANATION:
Normal Regions are made up of at least 2 Availability Zones to allow for highly available architectures in the cloud. The actual number of AZs can vary per Region. There is a special class of Region called a 'Local Region' that have only 1 AZ, however that is viewed as an abnormal case by AWS.

QUESTION 4
When talking about AWS security, what does "Authorization" refer to?

[ ] Logging in to the console
[ ] Evaluating what permissions a user has
[ ] A user delegating access to another user temporarily
[ ] Identifying who is accessing the system

EXPLANATION:
Authentication identifies who is accessing the system and passes that information to the Authorization process, which in turn determines what permissions the user has in AWS. Although Authorization is a part of the process to log in to the console, by itself it it is not enough.

Answer: b

QUESTION 6
Which of the below are TRUE when running a database in an EC2 Instance?

[ ] The customer is responsible for managing access to the database
[ ] The customer is responsible for updating the database software
[ ] The customer is responsible for updating the operating system
[ ] AWS is responsible for updating the database software
[ ] AWS is responsible for managing access to the database
[ ] AWS is responsible for updating the operating system

EXPLANATION:
In this case - as the database is being run in an EC2 instance, all aspects of database updates and access is the responsibility of the customer. Similarly as it is and EC2 instance, the customer is responsible for OS patching. Under the Shared Responsibility Model, AWS takes responsibility for managing all the hardware (including access, patching and other maintenance) and software required to deliver the service - which in this case is the EC2 instance - anything to do with the instance itself is the responsibility of the customer

QUESTION 8
You would like to give an application running on one of your EC2 instances access to an S3 bucket - what is the best way to implement this?

[ ] Make the bucket public
[ ] Use an IAM user for the application
[ ] Assign the instance an IAM role
[ ] Give the application a set of Access Keys

EXPLANATION:
The recommended method to assign permissions to apps running in EC2 is to use IAM roles. Making the bucket public could work, but will also expose all the data to the internet and is not secure. The other methods are also less secure than using IAM roles and are not recommended in this case.

Answer: c

QUESTION 18
Which of the following are best practices when it comes to securing your AWS account?

[ ] Store your Root account keys on your application for easy access.
[ ] Activate MFA on the Root Account.
[ ] Delete your Root access keys.
[ ] Create individual IAM users.
[ ] Apply an IAM password policy.
[ ] Use groups to assign permissions.
[ ] Delete your Root account password.

EXPLANATION:
Creating individual IAM users, using groups to assign them permission and creating a strong password policy are all key components of securing your AWS account. The root user should only be used in emergencies, therefore there should be no need to have Root Access Keys which allow the root user Programmatic access - any Programmatic access should use something other than the root account. It is not possible to delete the root password, and this should be securely, safely stored and not used in any applications!

Answer: b, c, d, e, f

[ ] AWS is responsible for the security of the hardware the data resides on
[ ] The customer is responsible for the security of the hardware the data resides on
[ ] The customer is responsible for the security of the software that manages the data

EXPLANATION:
Under the Shared Responsibility Model, AWS takes responsibility for managing all the hardware (including access, patching and other maintenance) and software required to deliver the service - which includes security. The customer is responsible for who can access the data itself.

Answer: a, c, d

QUESTION 29

QUESTION 32
A consulting firm is conducting a Sarbanes-Oxley compliance audit of your IT operations. The auditor requests visibility to logs of event history across your AWS-based employee expense system infrastructure. Which AWS service will record and provide give you the information you need?

[ ] AWS CloudWatch Logs
[ ] AWS Systems Manager
[ ] AWS CloudTrail
[ ] AWS Compliance Manager

EXPLANATION:
AWS CloudTrail provides visibility to API call activity for AWS infrastructure and other services. AWS Cloudwatch Logs might be part of a centralized logging solution, but all API event information will come from CloudTrail. AWS Systems Manager can process EC2 logs only, and AWS Compliance Manager is not a service offered by AWS.

Answer: c

QUESTION 35
What is the recommended way to give your applications running in EC2 permission to other AWS resources?

[ ] Create an Root Access Key and use it in the application.
[ ] Create an IAM User with appropriate permissions and assign it to the instance.
[ ] Create an IAM Group with appropriate permissions and assign it to the instance.
[ ] Create an IAM Role with appropriate permissions and assign it to the instance.

EXPLANATION:
You should use IAM Roles wherever possible to enable applications running on EC2 instances to access other AWS resources. This is the most secure method to do so. It is not possible to assign an IAM Group or User to an instance, and although using the Root Keys in you application would work this is HIGHLY insecure and should never be done, as the Root Keys have access to absolutely everything in your account.

Answer: d

QUESTION 42

Answer: a

QUESTION 51
Which of the following acts like built-in firewalls per instance for your virtual servers?

[ ] Security Groups
[ ] Network Access Control Lists
[ ] Route Tables
[ ] Availability Zones

EXPLANATION:
Security Groups act like built-in firewalls for your virtual servers - the rules you create define what is allowed to talk to your instances and how. Although Network Access Control Lists can be used to block or deny traffic, these operate at the subnet level - covering all instances in the subnet with the same ruleset, not per-instance as the question specifies. Route tables tell traffic where it should go next to reach its destination, and an Availability Zone is a collection of datacentres - which isn't relevant in this question.

Answer: a

Which of the below is true about root accounts on AWS?

[ ] The root user will be used by AWS should they need to help you with something in your account
[ ] The root user is the recommended way to work in the AWS Console
[ ] The root user has full access to everything in the AWS account
[ ] The root user should not be used for day to day activities
[ ] The root user should be disabled after you create an Admin user

EXPLANATION:
The root user has access to absolutely everything in an AWS account, and therefore should not be used for normal day to day activities and be reserved for when things go wrong. AWS will never ask you for any usernames or passwords as part of a support request - so any request to do so should be treated with suspicion. The root user cannot be disabled.

A new System Administrator has started with your organisation and requires a user account so that they can manage you AWS resources. You have AWS resources in multiple regions - what needs to be done to allow the new starter access to manage resources in the regions you operate in?

[ ] Create an IAM role in each region that you have resources in - this will enable access in per region
[ ] Create a single IAM user account - this will enable access in all regions
[ ] Create a single IAM role - this will enable access in all regions
[ ] Create an IAM user account in each region that you have resources in - this will enable access in per region

EXPLANATION:
Any answer that suggest a role is incorrect as roles by themselves will not let a user log in. The correct approach is to create an IAM user - and as IAM is a global service - configuration in IAM applies globally, not just regionally, only a single IAM user account is required.

Answer: b

QUESTION 57
Which of the below is TRUE when considering subnets in a VPC?

[ ] Subnets within a VPC can only communicate with each other if an Internet Gateway is deployed
[ ] By default, all subnets within a VPC can communicate with each other
[ ] By default, subnets within a VPC cannot communicate with each other
[ ] Subnets within a VPC can only communicate with each other if a NAT Gateway is deployed

EXPLANATION:
By default, all subnets within a VPC can communicate with each other, without needing any other resources or configuration. NAT Gateway and Internet Gateway work in different scenarios to allow your subnet to communicate with the internet and are not required to communicate between subnets

Answer: b

QUESTION 63
You have just created a new bucket and uploaded a file into it - will this be automatically viewable by anyone on the internet?

[ ] Only if you have an Internet Gateway
[ ] No - by default buckets and their contents are private
[ ] Only if you have a NAT Gateway
[ ] Yes - by default buckets and their contents are public

EXPLANATION:
By default, all data stored in S3 is NOT viewable by the public. If you want a bucket or object to be accessible by the public, you must explicitly make it so. NAT Gateways and Internet Gateways are needed to allow communications between VPCs and the internet, but are not required when it comes to S3

Answer: b
